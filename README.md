## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- AI: Genkit + Google AI Studio (Gemini)

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommend LTS)
- npm or pnpm
- Firebase project (to use Auth/Firestore/Storage)
- Google AI Studio API key (Gemini) if you want AI features

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup (Local Development)

1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viraj0001166/Taliyo-Employe-Tracker.git
cd Taliyo-Employe-Tracker
```

2) Install dependencies
```bash
# with npm
npm install
# or with pnpm
pnpm install
```

3) Environment variables
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real values.
- Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are safe for the browser.

`.env.example` contains:
```
# Google AI Studio / Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=

# Firebase Web App Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Admin (public, client-side bootstrap only)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=
```

4) Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
The app starts at http://localhost:9002 (see `package.json` -> `dev`).

### Firebase Configuration

1) Enable the following products in your Firebase project:

- Authentication (Email/Password or your chosen provider)
- Firestore (in Native/Production mode)
- Storage (default bucket)

2) Deploy security rules

```bash
# Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

3) Optional: Use Firebase Emulators for local dev

```bash
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage
# Then set (in .env.local)
# FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
# FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9199
```

## üî¢ NPM Scripts

From `package.json`:
- `dev` ‚Äî Next.js dev with Turbopack on port 9002
- `build` ‚Äî Next.js production build
- `start` ‚Äî Start the production server
- `lint` ‚Äî Lint the project
- `typecheck` ‚Äî TypeScript type-check only
- `genkit:dev` ‚Äî Start Genkit runtime and your AI dev server (`src/ai/dev.ts`)
- `genkit:watch` ‚Äî Same as above but with watch mode

Examples:
```bash
# app dev server
npm run dev

# AI dev tools (in a second terminal)
npm run genkit:dev
```

## üîê Security & Environment

- Never commit `.env` files. `.gitignore` already ignores them.
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are exposed on the client. Keep secrets server-side.
- Review `firestore.rules` before going live.
- Review `storage.rules` and test uploads/downloads in both dev and prod.

### Important env vars (excerpt)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL=hr@yourcompany.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_KB_URL=https://kb.yourcompany.com
```

## ü§ñ AI / Genkit

- Code: `src/ai/genkit.ts` and `src/ai/flows/*`
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Dev tools: `npm run genkit:dev` (or `genkit:watch`)

## üö¢ Deployment

- Vercel (recommended)
  - Add environment variables in Project Settings
  - Build command: `next build`
  - Output: Next.js default

- Firebase Hosting (optional)
  - Ensure your setup supports Next.js SSR (Cloud Functions/Hosting Integration)
  - Configure via `firebase.json`
  - Deploy rules/hosting as needed (requires Firebase CLI)

## üé® Design System & UX

- Tailwind semantic tokens: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `muted`, `card`, etc.
- Shadcn/ui primitives for consistent, accessible components.
- Dark mode tokens tuned for high contrast and readability.
- Pre-hydration theme script to avoid theme flash.
- Responsive grids and full-width actions on mobile where appropriate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Unknown error in Firebase Console while editing Storage rules
  - Cause: Console glitch/billing/permissions. Solution: deploy locally with CLI.
  - `firebase login && firebase use <PROJECT_ID> && firebase deploy --only storage`

- PNPM frozen lockfile failure in CI (`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`)
  - Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` locally, commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and ensure CI uses PNPM consistently.

- Avatar upload doesn‚Äôt reflect in header
  - We write to Storage at `users/{uid}/profile/*`, update Auth `photoURL`, and `users/{uid}.avatar`.
  - Header live-subscribes to Auth + Firestore to reflect updates instantly.
  - Verify Storage and Firestore rules are deployed; re-login if needed.

## üß™ Testing (coming soon)
- Add test setup (Jest/Playwright) if needed.

## üß≠ Roadmap (ideas)
- Advanced analytics & leaderboards
- Role-based permissions (Granular)
- More AI-driven suggestions & automations

## üôå Contributing
- Fork the repo
- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-thing`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: add amazing thing"`
- Push and open a PR

## üìÑ License
- MIT (add a `LICENSE` file if not already present)
